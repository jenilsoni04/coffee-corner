Got it ✅ Since your **coffee-corner** repo is just a small project to understand **SEO, sitemap, and how SEO works**, here’s a clean **README.md** you can copy-paste into your repo:

# ☕ Coffee Corner – SEO Learning Project

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to understand **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** concepts, **sitemaps**, and how search engines crawl and index websites.  

The website is a simple static site with multiple pages (`index.html`, `menu.html`, `contact.html`) styled using CSS.  
It also includes SEO-related files like **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** to explore how search engines interact with them.  

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn the basics of **on-page SEO** (title tags, meta descriptions, alt text, etc.).
- Understand the role of **sitemaps** in guiding search engine crawlers.
- Explore how **robots.txt** can allow or restrict indexing.
- Test how different pages and resources (HTML, CSS, media) are handled by crawlers.

- **Metadata**: Title, description, and keywords in `<head>` improve visibility.  
- **Internal Linking**: Connecting pages (`menu`, `contact`) from homepage for crawlability.  
- **Robots.txt**: Used to block or allow bots from crawling certain files.  
- **Sitemap.xml**: Provides a structured list of pages for search engines.

## 📜 Learning Outcome

This project was created to **practice SEO fundamentals** in a small-scale website before applying them to larger projects. It helped me understand how:

* Search engines crawl websites.
* `robots.txt` controls crawler behavior.
* `sitemap.xml` assists in indexing.
* Proper structure improves SEO ranking.

💡 *This is not a full-fledged product website, but a mini project to experiment with SEO concepts.*

Would you like me to also add a **GitHub Pages deployment link section** (so people can click and see your site live once Pages works)?

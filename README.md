# ☕ Coffee Corner – SEO Learning Project

## 🌍 Live Demo

🔗 **[View Website on GitHub Pages](https://jenilsoni04.github.io/coffee-corner/)**

-----

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to understand **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** concepts, **sitemaps**, and how search engines crawl and index websites.

The website is a simple static site with multiple pages (`index.html`, `menu.html`, `contact.html`) styled using CSS. It also includes SEO-related files like **`robots.txt`** and **`sitemap.xml`** to explore how search engines interact with them.

-----

## 🎯 Objective

  - Learn the basics of **on-page SEO** (title tags, meta descriptions, alt text, etc.).
  - Understand the role of **sitemaps** in guiding search engine crawlers.
  - Explore how **`robots.txt`** can allow or restrict indexing.
  - Test how different pages and resources (HTML, CSS, media) are handled by crawlers.

## 🔍 SEO Concepts Covered

  * **Indexing & Crawling**: Search engines discover pages via `sitemap.xml` and are guided by `robots.txt`.
  * **Metadata**: `title`, `description`, and keywords in the `<head>` tag improve search visibility.
  * **Internal Linking**: Connecting pages (e.g., from the homepage to the menu and contact pages) improves crawlability.
  * **`robots.txt`**: Used to block or allow bots from crawling certain files or directories.
  * **`sitemap.xml`**: Provides a structured list of all important pages for efficient discovery by search engines.
